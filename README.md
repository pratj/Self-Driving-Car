The Traffic Sign Recognition project uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to train the german traffic sign dataset taken from 
https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs which includes around 50000 labeled images. This model gives the metrics:
loss of 0.0679 - acc: 0.9795 - val_loss: 0.0560 - val_acc: 0.9889 on 10 epochs for a test image.
